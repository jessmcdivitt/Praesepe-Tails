# Praesepe-Tails
This repository contains files used to create color vs period and color vs magnitude plots for selected stars. 
* The Cumulative Praesepe Tails Table file is a csv containing quality ratings for the stars' measured periods, based on Causal Pixel Modeling (CPM) and Simple Aperture Photometry (SAP).
* The Final Table file includes all of the information about the tidal tail candidates necessary for the creation of plots.
* The Color vs Absolute Magnitude and Color vs Apparent Magnitude files contain scripts to create both plots. The RNAAS plot file includes adjustments to the color vs absolute magnitude plot.
* The Period vs Color plot file creates a period color plot without any outlier adjustments. The period color plot with the outlier fix includes vertical lines to indicate the doubled periods of select outliers.
